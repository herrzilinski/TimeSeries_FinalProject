# TimeSeries_FinalProject
This repo is built for DATS6450-Time Series Analysis & Modeling final project
This project focus on analyze Metro Interstate Traffic Volume data retrieved from UCI 
Machine Learning Depository. After duplicates and outliers are detected and removed, 
we will subset the data set, and perform decomposition and stationarity check. After that 
we will develop base models and evaluate their forecast performance. Lastly, we will 
build a SARIMA model, derive prediction and forecast function, and examine how its 
forecast fair with base models.

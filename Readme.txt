Make sure all .py file are within same working directory.
Execute DATS6450_EDA.py and DATS6450_Time Series Analysis.py from IDE to generate plots in the report.
DATS6450_Interactive Modelling.py is not completed before due date, the parameter estimation tab is not working
due to button component issue. But the differencing tab works, so I included it just for your reference.
